# POC-Prisma with TypeScript

## Introduction
This project is a proof of concept (POC) for integrating Prisma, an open-source database ORM (Object-Relational Mapping), with TypeScript, a statically typed superset of JavaScript. Prisma makes it easy to manage and access databases in a typesafe manner, and TypeScript enhances the development experience by providing type checking and modern language features.
